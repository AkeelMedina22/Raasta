# What is Raasta?

Raasta is an undergraduate final-year project developed at Habib University. This project not only demonstrates the technical skills and expertise we have accumulated throughout the duration of our studies at Habib University but also addresses a critical issue that is regularly being faced by Karachi's citizens. Our website is available at [Raasta](https://raasta-web.web.app).

# Why Raasta?

Karachi's roads have been continuously neglected due to insufficient funding and mismanagement by local government officials, making it an increasingly challenging and dangerous experience for commuters and transporters alike. In 2017, road damage was responsible for approximately 10,500 (https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/930042-bumpy-rides) accidents in Karachi, and deteriorating roads are to blame for many reported accidents in Pakistan, with almost [55,000](https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/933362-road-safety) people losing their lives in road accidents over the past ten years. Worsening road conditions not only greatly reduce the operational lifetime of automobiles but also pose a severe threat to drivers' safety. with heavy vehicles and monsoon rainfalls greatly exacerbating the problem over the years. Additionally, the physical health of individuals is also affected by poor road infrastructure, as approximately [56%](https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/977712-dilapidated-roads-of-karachi-causing-joint-issues-for-motorcyclists) of young motorcyclists in Karachi suffer from chronic lower back pain as a result of injuries sustained due to poor road conditions, further underscoring the urgent need for effective road maintenance. 

To address this issue, we have developed a road surface classification system using mobile sensing technology. Leveraging smartphone sensors like a tri-axial accelerometer, gyroscope, and GPS receiver, road surface data is collected and used to train a deep learning model. The system utilizes deep learning for multi-class classification to detect potholes and other road surface anomalies and provide their location information through a Flutter web application. This system hopes to significantly improve driver safety and route planning in Karachi and other cities facing similar road maintenance challenges, aiding commuters and drivers in making better-informed choices to ensure a safer and more comfortable traveling experience. This system can benefit government officials by providing access to a comprehensive database of detected road surface anomaly location points, enabling them to identify and prioritize areas that require immediate repair and maintenance. By using this system, officials can effectively allocate resources towards road maintenance and management, reducing the number of accidents and improving road conditions for everyone.
